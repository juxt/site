== What is Site?

[.lead]
Site is a place to keep records.

Site provides access to records over HTTPS. To supoprt this, each record is
identified with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URIs) and becomes a web resource.

Site allows applications to manage these resources, via user-defined APIs.

Site can protect resources from unauthorized access, and log access to resources
when required.

Site retains a full history.

=== What specific problem does Site solve?

[.lead]
Site makes it quicker and cheaper to develop and deploy high-quality custom API
services for data-centric applications.

In our consulting work, we've found that software projects frequently require
API services and that these are often written bespoke by teams of developers.

Many API services are mere proxies to an underlying set of data resources in a
database. Often these APIs do little more than the following repetitive tasks:

* Route HTTP requests to the relevant code handling the request
* Transform data coming in and going out, to the required format
* Access an underlying database to store and retrieve data
* If necessary, protect the service from unauthorized access
* Document the API for developers of software clients and services that need
  to access the service, e.g. OpenAPI or GraphQL

Where such services can be described _declaratively_, it is possible for Site to
host them, just like HTML pages.

APIs are thereby defined in a _database_, rather than _codebase_.

For this reason, API services hosted by Site should be:

* faster to develop;
* easier to secure;
* fully auditable, able to answer questions about who did what, when;
* more conformant with the HTTPS protocol, thereby making the API a 'good
  citizen' when interoperating with other services and components in a wider
  software architecture.

_So, while Site offers many other features which can be found in other software,
the ability to rapidly deploy API services from declarative specifications is
unique to Site (to the best of our knowledge)._

=== What kind of software is Site?

Site is server software, written in the Clojure programming language.

Site embeds JUXT's XTDB database and runs on th JVM.

Site can run on a local machine or remote server, on premise or in the cloud.

=== What is the relationship between Site and REST?

REST is a term coined by Roy Fielding to describe a certain _architectural
style_, one that underpins the web.

The term 'RESTful' is informally applied to web APIs that try to conform to the
principles described in Fielding's original dissertation.

NOTE: TODO, we're not done here

=== What is the relationship between Site and OAuth?

In https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.1[RFC 6749], OAuth defines four roles:

[quote]
____
resource owner
   An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.
   When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an
   end-user.

resource server
   The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting
   and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

client
   An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the
   resource owner and with its authorization.  The term "client" does
   not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g.,
   whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other
   devices).

authorization server
   The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully
   authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
____

In a wider architecture, Site can play the roles of a Resource Server
and,optionally, an Authorization Server. It is able to fully interact with other
components that play the other OAuth roles in a standards compliant manner.

== This book

This book teaches Site from 'the ground up'.

This is partly for pedagogical purposes. It is a good idea to learn in depth how
Site's builds up its secure foundation.

But if you are in a hurry, there are (or will be) quicker 'install packs' and
Docker images that provide shortcuts to setting up a Site instance.

=== Conventions used in this book

==== Reader interventions

We use an admonition with an exclamation mark to indicate where we require that
you act, and do something. In code, the exclamation mark is commonly used to
indicate a side-effect. In this book, the side-effect is carried out by the
reader!

==== Proper nouns

Where nouns are well specified and appear in a glossary, we write them as proper
nouns rather than common nouns. Whenever such a noun is capitalised, it has the
formal meaning as defined in the <<glossary>> rather than its common
meaning. This allows us to use common nouns with less risk of confusion.


==== Keyword namespaces

Many of the examples in this document use Clojure keywords.

Keywords can have namespaces. For example, the keyword `:foo.bar/zip` is a keyword
with the namespace is `foo.bar`.

As a convention in this document, keyword namespaces are only used for
_reserved_ keywords that have some meaning to Site. The majority of other
keywords are not namespaced, to indicate that they are _arbitary_. However, it
is recommended that you use keyword namespaces that reflect their origin
(e.g. using a domain name that is owned by you or your organisation).
