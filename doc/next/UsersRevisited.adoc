= Users Revisited
:toc: left
:experimental:

In <<ch-users>> we put Documents directly the database to represent an initial User.

Actions can't be invoked without a User, yet Actions, but Actions are required
to create Users. We had a chicken-and-egg situation that we resolved by directly
inserting the first user by hand.

However, now that we have built the capability to create Actions and
Permissions, we can build the Actions to create new Users, User Identities and
Subjects. That's the subject of this chapter.

== Create an action to create a user

An Action to create a User should take a new Document describing the User,
validate that the `:juxt.site.alpha/type` attribute is set to
`https://meta.juxt.site/pass/user` and other required checks. For example, a
User might be required to have a name and other required attributes.

<<ex-create-action-put-user>> demonstrates the creation of an Action that
fulfils these criteria.

<1> Check the format of the id.

<2> Check the type.

<3> Default the type, if not given in the argument.

<4> Allow the user details to be retrieved via the GET method, with the
`https://site.test/actions/get-user` Action.

<5> Ensure only roles with a Permission are able to perform this Action.

== Create an Action to create a User Identity

In the same way, we may also need the ability to create a User Identity. For
this Action it is important that the Document given in the document refers to
the User it is identifying.

See <<ex-create-action-put-user-identity>> for a demonstration of creating and
permitting an Action that meets these requirements.
