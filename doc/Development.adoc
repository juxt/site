= Development

Start the API Server, or jack-in with your favorite editor.

----
$ clj -Adev
----

On the first startup, there will be a number of repos cloned, which may take up to a few minutes.

Wait for the Clojure prompt:

----
Clojure 1.10.1
user=>
----

Type `(dev)`

----
user=> (dev)
----

Wait for the code to compile, and then start the API server with `(go)`:

----
[Edge] Loading Clojure code, please wait...
[Edge] Enter (go) to start the dev system
dev=> (go)
----

You should get something similar to the following:

----
Starting Crux node
[Edge] Now make code changes, then enter (reset) here
:initiated
----

If this is your first time running Site, you'll need to initialize your
database. This adds various resources, such as the webmaster user which you'll
need to begin adding your own resources. This is as per the top-level README.

Now browse at https://localhost:2021 and login with the username you created.
