= Preliminaries

If you're in a hurry, or want to get started quickly with Site, you should skip
these chapters and move onto <<ch-resources>>.

However, in keeping with our value of <<understanding,Understanding>>, we
recommended that you invest time in building up both your working and conceptual
knowledge of Site. These chapters will help to build up your knowledge of Site
'from scratch'. If you've chosen this course, welcome to the slow track!
