= Error resources

Site allows errors to be represented with custom representations.

====
First, create an error resource.

== Next Steps

We have a protected resource but the 401 status response tells us we are not
authorized to access it.

To authorize the subject we'll need to first determine who is trying to access
the resource.

== Improving the 401 error

If the user is using a browser, it's a better user experience if we provide them
with a button to click to take them through the authentication process, and
return them to the original resource once they've been authenticated.

<<installing-improved-401>> demonstrates how we can do this.

Remember the `401 Unauthorized` response we got back in
<<publishing-protected-resources>>? Now we can at least authenticate the end-user.

.Testing the authentication
[[testing-authentication]]
====
If we now nagivate to +https://site.test/protected.html+ we get the following:

.Unauthorized
image::Unauthorized.png[Unauthorized,width=50%]

Clicking on btn:[Login] directs us to the `Application Login URI` that we have
installed for our `OpenID Provider`.

If all goes as expected, the error should change to a 403. This means we've
successfully _authenticated_, but still don't have the _permission_ to view the
protected resource. That's a topic for <<authorization>>.
