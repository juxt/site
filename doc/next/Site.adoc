= Preliminaries

If you're in a hurry, or want to get started quickly with Site, you should skip
these chapters and move onto <<ch-resources>>.

However, in keeping with our value of <<understanding,Understanding>>, we
recommended that you invest time in building up both your working and conceptual
knowledge of Site. These chapters will help to build up your knowledge of Site
'from scratch'. If you've chosen this course, welcome to the slow track!

= Authentication

Actions are integrated with authorization rules, providing a rich access control
layer between users and data.

Most authorization rules refer to the Subject of the request. To identify the
Subject, we need to authenticate each request.

Site supports two options for authenticating users:

* HTTP Authentication, as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7235[RFC 7235], which we describe in <<ch-http-authentication>>.

* Cookie-based authentication, which we describe in <<ch-cookie-authentication>>.

= Applications and APIs


First, in <<ch-applications>>, we introduce Applications and create the required
Actions.

We start by configuring our Authorization Server in <<ch-authorization-server>>.

Then, in <<ch-first-application>>, we create an example Application.
