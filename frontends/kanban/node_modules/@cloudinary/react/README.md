import { AdvancedImage } from '@cloudinary/react'
import {CloudinaryImage} from '@cloudinary/url-gen';
```

### Transform and Optimize Assets
- [See full documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/react_image_manipulation)

```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { AdvancedImage } from '@cloudinary/react'
import {CloudinaryImage} from '@cloudinary/url-gen';

const myCld = new Cloudinary({ cloudName: 'demo'});
let img = myCld().image('sample');

const App = () => {
  return <AdvancedImage cldImg={img}/>
};
```
    ```
### Generate Image and Video HTML Tags
    - Use <AdvancedImage> to generate image tags
    - Use <AdvancedVideo> to generate video tags

### Advanced Plugin Features
- [See full documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/react_integration#plugins)
<br/><br/>
We recommend the following order when using our plugins to achieve the best results:
<br/><br/>

```tsx
import { CloudinaryImage } from "@cloudinary/url-gen";
import {
  lazyload,
  responsive,
  accessibility,
  placeholder
} from "@cloudinary/react";

cloudinaryImage = new CloudinaryImage("sample", { cloudName: "demo" });

const App = () => {
  return <AdvancedImage cldImg={img} plugins = {[lazyload(),responsive(), accessibility(), placeholder()]};/>
};
```

You can omit any plugin, but the order from above should remain.

### File upload
This SDK does not provide file upload functionality, however there are [several methods of uploading from the client side](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/react_image_and_video_upload).
