== Creating a private resource

Now let's publish an immutable private resource which can only be seen by an
authenticated user.

We'll need an action to publish a private resource.


.Creating and accessing a private resource
====

Again, let's complete the following steps:

[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=create-action-put-immutable-private-resource!,indent=0]
----

[IMPORTANT]
--
Do it
--

We'll grant this permission to our REPL user.

[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=grant-permission-to-put-immutable-private-resource!,indent=0]
----

[IMPORTANT]
--
Do it
--

Now we'll create the action that is used to get a private resource. The rules
mandate that a permission has been granted on a specific resource and the
subject is not nil.

[source,clojure]
.Creating the `get-private-resource` action
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=create-action-get-private-resource,indent=0]
----

[IMPORTANT]
--
Do it
--

The `get-private-resource` action's rules state that a single 'global'
permission (referencing the action) is sufficient for _any_ authenticated
end-user (subject) to access the action.

But we must rememeber to create that single global permission:

[source,clojure]
.Creating the global grant on `get-private-resource` to authenticated users
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=grant-permission-to-get-private-resource!,indent=0]
----

Do it

Now to create a private resource.

[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=create-immutable-private-resource!,indent=0]
----

[IMPORTANT]
--
Do it
--

Let's try to access the private resource.

----
curl -i https://site.test/private.html
----

We should get a response with a 401 status. We're not authorized to access this
resource.
