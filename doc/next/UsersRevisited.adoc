= Users Revisited
:toc: left
:experimental:

In <<ch-users>> we put Documents directly the database to represent an initial User.

Actions can't be invoked without a User, yet Actions, but Actions are required
to create Users. We had a chicken-and-egg situation that we resolved by directly
inserting the first user by hand.

However, now that we have built the capability to create Actions and
Permissions, we can build the Actions to create new Users, Identities and
Subjects. That's the subject of this chapter.
