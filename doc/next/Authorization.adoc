=== Create a user

To remotely access the system, we'll first have to build a user.

For this example, we'll model a user as a combination of:

- A *person*,

- A person's *identity*, as issued from a trusted entity such as an OAuth2
  Authorization Server, Identity Provider or equivalent,

- A *subject* which represents the person's current *session*, including details
  of how they logged in.

NOTE: We don't have to model a user this way, and for some applications this
might be overly simplistic. Site allows you to model your own users as you see
fit, as long as there is something to represent a *subject*.

For the purposes of this example, we'll create a person entity to represent the
person.

We'll use the name `Alice` but feel free to replace this with your own personal
details.

==== Create an action to create a person

First, we'll need to create an action which will create our person entity.

=== Create an identity to identify Alice

Now we need to register an *identity* for Alice so that we can trust her.

////
.Keep this for when we need to create a subject for Alice
****
We do this because we may want our rules to take into account other aspects of
Alice's session rather than just the fact that it belongs to Alice. For example,
we may want some actions to be denied if Alice is logging in from an insecure
location or from a different country.
