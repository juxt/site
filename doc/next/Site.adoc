= Preliminaries

If you're in a hurry, or want to get started quickly with Site, you should skip
these chapters and move onto <<ch-resources>>.

However, in keeping with our value of <<understanding,Understanding>>, we
recommended that you invest time in building up both your working and conceptual
knowledge of Site. These chapters will help to build up your knowledge of Site
'from scratch'. If you've chosen this course, welcome to the slow track!

= Authentication

(((access control)))
Actions are integrated with authorization rules, providing a rich access control
layer between users and data.

(((Subject)))
Most authorization rules refer to the Subject of the request. To identify the
Subject, we need to authenticate each request.

Site supports two broad categories of user authentication:

. (((authentication,HTTP))) HTTP Authentication, which introduces the concept of
  _protection spaces_, specified in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7235[RFC
  7235], is described in <<ch-http-authentication>>. An example of HTTP
  Authentication is the 'Basic' authentication scheme, which is covered in
  <<ch-basic-authentication>>.

. (((authentication,cookie-based))) Cookie-based authentication, which we
  describe in <<ch-cookie-authentication>>, opens up numerous additional options
  for authentication. One such option is OpenID Connect, which is covered in
  <<ch-openid>> with a working example.

= Applications and APIs


First, in <<ch-applications>>, we introduce Applications and create the required
Actions.

We start by configuring our Authorization Server in <<ch-authorization-server>>.

Then, in <<ch-first-application>>, we create an example Application.
