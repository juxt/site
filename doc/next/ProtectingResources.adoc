= Protecting Resources
:toc: left

== Introduction

For many record-keeping systems, it's necessary to protect resources from access
and modification from unauthorized users.

In this chapter we will create an Action for creating protected resources. These
preliminaries will be useful later on as we explore different approaches to
authentication.

== Create the Action to create a protected resource

We'll need an Action to create a protected resource. This is demonstrated in
<<creating-an-action-to-create-a-protected-resource>>.

.Creating an Action to create a protected resource
====
[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=create-action-put-immutable-protected-resource!,indent=0]
----

<1> Users making a GET request to this resource will require a permission to
perform the Action `+https://site.test/actions/get-protected-resource+`. This
Action doesn't yet exist (but we'll create it in
<<creating-action-get-protected-resource>>).

<2> We'll repeat our usual RBAC policy for this Action: we make this Action
accessible if a Permission exists that permits Users in a particular role to
perform this Action.

--
Copy the code in <<creating-an-action-to-create-a-protected-resource>> into a
REPL, edit as required and evaluate.
--

As per our Action's rules, we'll need to grant a Permission so that our REPL user can perform it. This Permission is created in
<<permit-admins-to-create-a-protected-resource>>.

Copy the code in <<permit-admins-to-create-a-protected-resource>> into a REPL,
edit as required and evaluate.

In <<creating-an-action-to-create-a-protected-resource>>, we restricted access
to the resource to those Users who are authorized to perform the
`+https://site.test/actions/get-protected-resource+`
Action. <<creating-action-get-protected-resource>> demonstrates the creation
this Action.

<1> The Permission must directly reference the User.

<2> The Permission must _also_ directly reference the Resource that is being
protected. There are no roles used in this example, Permissions must exist for
every combination of User and Resource. Note, this may not be practical for many
systems, but works for these authentication examples.

Copy the code in <<creating-action-get-protected-resource>> into a REPL, edit as

Now we have created the Actions necessary to protect resources from unauthorized
Users, we can illustrate different approaches to User authentication.

Now to create a protected resource.

[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=create-immutable-protected-resource!,indent=0]
----

[IMPORTANT]
--
Do it
--

Let's try to access the protected resource.

----
curl -i https://site.test/protected.html
----

We should get a response with a 401 status. We're not authorized to access this
resource.

----
