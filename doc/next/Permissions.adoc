= Permissions
:toc: left

With Actions and Users established, we've got everything we need to start
creating other resources.

However, in practice, it is cumbersome to have to update Actions every time we
want to authorize a new User to perform an Action. This is where Permissions
come in.

(((permission, definition)))
Permissions are separate Documents that represent a specific authorization. A
document can be put into the database to represent a permission when it is
granted, and (just as easily) deleted from the database when the authorization
is revoked.

TIP: Permissions are straight-forward to grant and revoke, as they are represented as
XT documents, so granting and revoking a permission can be done with XTDB's
respective `:xtdb.api/put` and `:xtdb.api/delete` operations.

An Action's Rules specify how Permissions determine the outcome of authorization
decisions.

By writing Rules in terms of Permissions, as opposed to Users, grants and
revocations are easier to manage and report on.

== Document structure of a Permission

(((permission, document structure)))
<<permission-doc-structure>> lists the attributes found in Permission documents.

[%header,cols="2l,3d,1"]
|===
|Attribute|Value|Required?

|:xt/id
|Permssions are resources, so this is a URI.
s|Required

|:juxt.site.alpha/type
l|"https://meta.juxt.site/pass/permission"
s|Required

|:juxt.pass.alpha/action
|The URI of the Action this Permission grants access to.
s|Required

|:juxt.pass.alpha/purpose
|The purpose of the Permission. Can be nil.
s|Required

== Creating a permission

We must install a Permission which will allow our user to call our
`create-action` Action.

This gives us an opportunity to inspect the document structure of a real
Permission.

<<example-put-permission-to-create-action>> demonstrates creating a Permission
that works with the Action we created in <<example-create-action>>.

<1> Permissions are individual resources, and must have unique URIs.

<2> Each Permission must have a `:juxt.site.alpha/type` attribute of
"`Permission`".

<3> The Permission must be tied to a specific Action.

<4> The Permission can be granted for a particular purpose, but if not, this
attribute must be nil.

<5> In this case, the Permission references the `Administrator` role. All Users
with this `Administrator` role will be able to call the
`+https://site.test/actions/create-action+` action.

[NOTE]
--
In future we might allow different users using the same REPL to identify
themselves. Of course, REPL users have no restrictions to what they can do, so
this is just for audit purposes among trusted users.
--

WARNING: Access to the REPL must be restricted to a very limited set of
authorized users.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Grant your user the Permission to invoke the create-action function you created in <<example-create-action>>:

. Copy the code in <<example-put-permission-to-create-action>> to an editor.
. Update it according to the Base URI you have chosen.
. Copy the modified code into the REPL.
. Evaluate!
--

== Creating the grant-permssion action

We have now created a `create-action` Action and granted a Permission for our
User to invoke it. Let's invoke this action to create a new `grant-permission`
action.

<<ex-create-grant-permission-action>> demonstrates how this is achieved.

.Creating the grant-permission action
[[ex-create-grant-permission-action]]

[source,clojure]

include::../../test/juxt/demo.clj[tag=create-grant-permission-action!,indent=0]

[IMPORTANT]
--
Create the grant-permission action by following these steps:

. Copy the code from <<ex-create-grant-permission-action>> into an editor
. Make appropriate changes
. Copy into the REPL
. Evaluate
--

Finally, we need to permit our REPL user to invoke this grant-permission action, and this
permission too needs to be put directly into the database since we don't yet
have a way of granting permissions!

This is shown in <<ex-permit-grant-permission-action>>.

Permit the grant-permission action by following these steps:

. Copy the code from <<ex-permit-grant-permission-action>> into an editor
. Make appropriate changes
. Copy into the REPL
. Evaluate

Now that we have the ability to create actions, and grant permissions to invoke
them, we have the building blocks we need to start creating
<<ch-resources,Resources>>.
