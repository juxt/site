        ;; Additional scenarios:

        ;; Alice, Bob, Carlos - multiple joins, 3-level queries, multiple concurrent actions

        ;; The challenge is to combine the following:

        ;; 1. GraphQL schemas where fields in queries reference actions. For example:
        ;;
        ;; type Hospital { patients: [String] @site(action: https://site.test/actions/list-patients) }
        ;;
        ;; type Doctor { patients: [String] @site(action: https://site.test/actions/list-patients-by-doctor) }

        ;; Should https://site.test/actions/list-patients-by-doctor exist
        ;; independently or instead be a reference to
        ;; https://site.test/actions/list-patients with a join key? The former
        ;; is overly cumbersome and would require a lot of extra actions and
        ;; associated admin costs.

        ;; type Doctor {
        ;;   id ID
        ;;   patients(gender: String, costBasis: String): [Patient] @site(action: "https://site.test/actions/list-patients" join: "primary-doctor")
        ;; }

        ;; The `patients` field transforms to a sub-query.

        ;; This sub-query is composed using the rules of list-patients.

        ;; Additional clauses are added that correspond to the arguments, with
        ;; optional arg->attribute mappings specified in (GraphQL) field
        ;; directive.

        ;; The 'join' key becomes an implicit argument. By default, the 'id' of
        ;; the doctor is passed as the argument value.

        ;; 2. Actions that have 'query' logic. Should that query logic be Flip?
        ;; Or reference other actions? To what extent is 'list-patients = fmap
        ;; get-patient' - is this a common case? Looks like we may need a
        ;; 'calculus' for defining actions in terms of other more fundamental
        ;; actions. Note: I think we're just seeing that get-patient and
        ;; list-patient *share* the same rules. There is no reason rules can't
        ;; be deduped via reference to independent documents, or even one to the
        ;; other:

        ;; {:xt/id "list-patients" ::pass/rules "get-patient"}

        ;; Idea: Break GraphQL schemas into constituent types and create
        ;; individual resources, one resource per type. Use 'set' difference to
        ;; identity types to delete. Create HTML from /graphql to show a nice
        ;; HTML page with a list of types.
