= Our First Application
:toc: left

In this chapter we'll create our first application and grant it access to our
resources.

We'll also be able to control exactly which resources this application can
access.


== Create the application

.Creating the application
[[example-create-application]]
====
[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=invoke-put-application!,indent=0]
----
====

== Authorize the application

====
[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=invoke-authorize-application!,indent=0]
----
====

== Create a test subject

====
[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=create-test-subject!,indent=0]
----
====

== Issue the access token

====
[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/book.clj[tag=invoke-issue-access-token!,indent=0]
----
====

== Use the access token to access the resource

NOTE: Developer note: TODO


----
curl -i https://site.test/protected.html -H "Authorization: Bearer test-access-token"
----

== Development Notes

[NOTE]
--
/authorize should create an 'ApplicationAuthorization' document, if one doesn't already exist, possibly it can update it too
/token should create an 'AccessToken' document, with subject, application and scope burned into it

.Restricting permissions to sessions
****
Currently there is the concern that we're granting permissions to the User,
which doesn't give us information about the login, so we can't grant permissions
conditional on certain login conditions being met.

Could we put an additional rules invocation against the permission? (Nope, we
can't dynamically load rules)

Alternatively, we can add two rules: if the permission has a user attribute, the first rule applies.
If the permission has a subject attribute, the second rule applies.

But that still doesn't solve our problem, since we want to restrict an action in
certain cases to, say, 2FA, which is only available on a Session.

The only solution seems to have separate actions, or even use purpose, or go
back to having a 'special' REPL user.
