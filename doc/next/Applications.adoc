== Introduction

Actions are invoked when users make direct requests to an API. However, APIs are
primarily designed to be used by applications acting on a user's behalf.

Applications must first be registered with Site. Then a User must authorize an
application to access an API on their behalf. Only then can an application
request a time-limited access token-from Site which it can present when making
API requests.

=== Scope

Actions can be grouped together into access ranges. For example, the actions
required for user administration might be grouped into an access range named
`user:admin`.

Applications might only need a limited set of these access ranges in order to
function. The allowed access ranges might be restricted during application
registration. This set of access ranges is called a 'scope'. An example scope
might be "`user:admin resources:read resources:write`"

During the application authorization step, the authorizing User might choose to
restrict the scope of access ranges an application can acquire.

Furthermore, applications might unilaterally request a restricted scope upon
requesting an access token.

No matter the ultimate scope of the access-token that is issued, an application
cannot use an access-token to invoke an action that would otherwise be
unavailable to a User.
