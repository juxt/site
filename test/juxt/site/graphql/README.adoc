= GraphQL Tests

These tests are built around a fictional hospital.

The healthcare example has been chosen because:

* Most people have direct experience, if only as a patient, of the domain.

* There are complex confidentiality and privacy requirements to handle.

* There are easily-understood examples of both analytical and real-time data,
  exercising query, mutation and subscriptions in GraphQL.

* Where GraphQL, as a form layer, can present a simplified view of a complex and
  technical data layer.
