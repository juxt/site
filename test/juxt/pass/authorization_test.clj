;; First, we define the actors.

;; define users in terms of the attributes of those users that are important to
;; the domain. So in this example we define our users without any keywords that
;; would be recognisable to site/pass.

;; Adding an authorization-provider

;; * An login endpoint that sets up the session and redirects to an issuer
;; * OpenID Authorization Server details (so we can do $issuer/.wellknown/openid-config)

;; * An identity (::site/type "Identity") that links to a user (::site/user) and has a matching iss/sub
;; * OpenID Connect client application details that have been registered with the OpenID Authorization Server
;; * A callback endpoint for the application (this will update the session and set the cookie)
