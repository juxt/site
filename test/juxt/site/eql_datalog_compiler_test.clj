        ;; A measurement must be taken by a doctor or other individual.
        ;; From the doctor, you can see patients.
        ;; A patient should be able to see their own medical file.

        ;; "The database consists of:
        ;; Job Roles (âRâ codes) - the set of roles that can be assigned to users, for example Clinical Practitioner (R8000)
        ;; Activities (âBâ codes) - the set of activities that users can perform, for

        ;; https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/spine-directory-service-fhir

        ;; Additional scenarios:

        ;; Alice, Bob, Carlos - multiple joins, 3-level queries, multiple concurrent actions

        ;; The challenge is to combine the following:

        ;; 1. GraphQL schemas where fields in queries reference actions. For example:
        ;;
        ;; type Hospital { patients: [String] @site(action: https://site.test/actions/list-patients) }
        ;;
        ;; type Doctor { patients: [String] @site(action: https://site.test/actions/list-patients-by-doctor) }

        ;; Should https://site.test/actions/list-patients-by-doctor exist
        ;; independently or instead be a reference to
        ;; https://site.test/actions/list-patients with a join key? The former
        ;; is overly cumbersome and would require a lot of extra actions and
        ;; associated admin costs. (DONE: we have gone with the notion of an action being called in the context of another)

        ;; type Doctor {
        ;;   id ID
        ;;   patients(gender: String, costBasis: String): [Patient] @site(action: "https://site.test/actions/list-patients" join: "primary-doctor")
        ;; }

        ;; The `patients` field transforms to a sub-query.

        ;; This sub-query is composed using the rules of list-patients.

        ;; Additional clauses are added that correspond to the arguments, with
        ;; optional arg->attribute mappings specified in (GraphQL) field
        ;; directive.

        ;; The 'join' key becomes an implicit argument. By default, the 'id' of
        ;; the doctor is passed as the argument value.

        ;; But, for many models, there is a xref relation. A patient's
        ;; relationship to a doctor is governed by a dedicated 'assignment'
        ;; document. This way, it is straight-forward to remove this assignment,
        ;; inspect a history of assignments, and to add further metadata about
        ;; the assignment.

        ;; The 'form' of the GraphQL should not expose this xref relation
        ;; directly, but use it to generate a mapping between patients and
        ;; doctors.

        ;; Where should the metadata for this xref relation be provided? For
        ;; example, if the assignment document has a type (and it certainly
        ;; should), where should this type be specificed? If it's directly in
        ;; the GraphQL SDL, then a) it both complicates and exposes the GraphQL
        ;; SDL to structural details and b) needs to be repeated for other
        ;; access protocols, like REST.

        ;; Therefore, it makes sense that the actions themselves understand how
        ;; to navigate these relationships. Actions can be both shared between
        ;; applications while still allowing applications to demand bespoke
        ;; actions where necessary.

        ;; Therefore it seems that actions are the 'form' documents.

        ;; Let's take the list-patients action. In the context of a doctor, it
        ;; needs to know how to join on the doctor id. The 'parent context',
        ;; whether it be a hosital, doctor or other type, is extremely common
        ;; (since data is often emitted as DAGs). Therefore each action should
        ;; be aware of the context in which it runs.

        ;; TODO: First, rewrite list-patients/get-patient to use SCI.

        ;; 2. Actions that have 'query' logic. Should that query logic be Flip?
        ;; Or reference other actions? To what extent is 'list-patients = fmap
        ;; get-patient' - is this a common case? Looks like we may need a
        ;; 'calculus' for defining actions in terms of other more fundamental
        ;; actions. Note: I think we're just seeing that get-patient and
        ;; list-patient *share* the same rules. There is no reason rules can't
        ;; be deduped via reference to independent documents, or even one to the
        ;; other:

        ;; {:xt/id "list-patients" ::pass/rules "get-patient"}

        ;; Idea: Break GraphQL schemas into constituent types and create
        ;; individual resources, one resource per type. Use 'set' difference to
        ;; identity types to delete. Create HTML from /graphql to show a nice
        ;; HTML page with a list of types.
