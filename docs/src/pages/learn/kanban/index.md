Welcome to those joining us from Strange Loop 2022! JUXT are a platinum sponsor this year - come and find us to say hi, learn more about Site, show us what you create, or ask for help if you get a bit stuck... We're friendly I promise!

If this brief introduction to Site and XTDB piques your interest, you can learn more from JUXTers in person over the conference weekend: **Jeremy Taylor** will be leading an [XTDB workshop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2022/bitemporal-data-management-with-xtdb.html) on Thursday 22nd, and **Håkan Råberg** will be speaking on [adaptive indexing for immutable databases](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2022/light-and-adaptive-indexing-for-immutable-databases.html) on Friday 23rd.
