<Intro>
It's best to think of Site as a 'server framework' rather than as a library. It includes a collection of libraries for handling the generation of REST and GraphQL APIs, as well as a <a href="https://xtdb.com">powerful Database</a> in which everything is stored.

The main goal of Site is to provide a simple way to store and retrieve data without needing to write any more code than needed.

In its current form, Site is an experiment, we recommend forking Site if you wish to use it in production yourself. Most updates are made to libraries used within Site rather than Site itself so keeping things up to date should not be difficult.

We are currently working on a rewrite of Site (progress can be seen in the 'actions' branch) which will allow Site to be used as a product while maintaining the flexibilty to write custom code and apply complex authorization rules.
