= Installation
:toc: left

== Requirements

Before you start, you'll need to have the following installed:

* Java 17+ (Site uses new Java APIs such as `java.util.HexFormat`)
* https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[Clojure]
* https://github.com/babashka/babashka[Babashka]
* https://curl.se/[curl]
* A webserver such as Apache or Nginx

== Before you start

* All these instructions are for Arch Linux, please amend accordingly for your own
platform, if different.

* Run each command under your user account (i.e. not as root).

* For documentation purposes, we'll assume your Site server will be set up to run
on the host `site.test`. If you choose another hostname, or are setting up for
production, please amend these instructions accordingly.

== Preparation

=== Decide on a fully qualified hostname

Site is a web server and is designed to be accessed over the network. Since Site
resources are identified by URIs, you should decide on a hostname in a domain
that you control.

For the purposes of learning, development and local testing, it is a good idea
to use a test hostname, such as `site.test`. These instructions are written
assuming that you've chosen `site.test` as your hostname. If you're using your
own hostname in a domain you control, amend these instructions accordingly.

=== Configure your local DNS or /etc/hosts

To access Site locally for bootstrapping we need to ensure requests to
`site.test` are directed to the local service.

Edit /etc/hosts to direct requests for `site.test` and `auth.site.test` to 127.0.0.1.

----
# Static table lookup for hostnames.
# See hosts(5) for details.
127.0.0.1	localhost site.test auth.site.test
----

=== mkcert

// TODO: Explain why we are doing this

Install mkcert

----
sudo pacman -Sy mkcert
----

----
mkcert -install
----

----
Created a new local CA 💥
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ⚡️
The local CA is now installed in the Firefox and/or Chrome/Chromium trust store (requires browser restart)! 🦊
----

=== Install nginx

----
sudo pacman -Sy nginx-mainline
----

=== Create private key and cert

Create a new cert for the local development server, and move these into your
nginx config directory.

----
mkcert site.test auth.site.test
sudo mv site.test+1.pem /etc/nginx/site.test.pem
sudo mv site.test+1-key.pem /etc/nginx/site.test-key.pem
----

=== Configure nginx

Configure nginx. Use `etc/dev/nginx.conf` as a guide to what to configure. You'll need to reference your private key and cert via the `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` parameters.

----
ssl_certificate      site.test.pem;
ssl_certificate_key  site.test-key.pem;
----

You'll need to increase the size of request bodies you can send through nginx,
the default is too restrictive.

----
client_max_body_size 16M;
----

You'll also need to configure the details of your the origin server (Site).

----
http {
  ...
  client_max_body_size 16M;
  ...
  server {
    ...
    ssl_certificate site.test.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key site.test-key.pem;
    ...
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:2021;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}
----

Test your final configuration before you start nginx and fix any errors.

----
sudo nginx -t
----

=== Start nginx

Start nginx

----
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
----

== Install Site

=== Clone this repo

----
$ git clone https://github.com/juxt/site
----

== Configure the Site service

=== Install the configuration file

There's a sample configuration in `etc` you should copy to `$HOME/.config/site/config.edn`.

----
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/site
$ cp site/etc/config.edn $HOME/.config/site/config.edn
----

IMPORTANT: If you're aren't using `site.test` as a hostname, edit the
configuration to replace `https://site.test` with the URI that corresponds to
the hostname you have chosen,

== Start the Site server

Start the Site server:

----
$ site/bin/site-server
----

NOTE: Alternatively, if you're familiar with Clojure development, you can start
the server via the `deps.edn` file and simply 'jack-in' with your editor or IDE
as normal.

////

(should retain this somewhere else)

=== Start multiple instances of the server

If you require multiple Site servers to coexist on the same machine, you can start site passing a different configuration file as follows:

----
$ SITE_CONFIG=/absolute/path/custom-site-config.edn site/bin/site-server
----

In this case please be sure to change the configuration so ports are different and XTDB files are stored in a separate folder than the ones specified in the example configuration file. You'll also need to specify Site host:port when using site commands, for example:

----
$ SITE_BASE_URI=http://localhost:5509 site/bin/site get-token -u admin
----
////

== Connect to Site's REPL

If you've run Site via your development environment and 'jacked-in' you'll
already have a REPL. Proceed to the next step.

If you're running Site with `site/bin/site-server`, you'll need to connect a
terminal to Site to access the REPL. You can do this via port `50505`, which is a
socket REPL that Site starts by default.

How you connect to this port is up to you. One way is via `ncat`, but you can replace `ncat` with `telnet`, or `netcat`, depending on what's available for your system.

[NOTE]
--
Arch users can install `ncat` by installing the `nmap` package:

----
$ sudo pacman -Sy nmap
----
--

----
$ ncat localhost 50505
----

[TIP]
--
Prefix the command with `rlwrap` if you have it installed.

----
$ rlwrap ncat localhost 50505
----
--

=== Introducing Site's REPL

----
Site by JUXT. Copyright (c) 2021, JUXT LTD.
Type :repl/quit to exit

site>
----

[TIP]
--
There are a few useful Site REPL commands you should be familiar with:

(ls):: List all resources
(ls <pat>):: List all resources whose URIs match the pattern
(evict! <uri>+):: Kill resource(s) across time
(put! <doc>+)):: Put one or more resources into the database
(factory-reset!):: Start over. (Delete everything in the database!)
