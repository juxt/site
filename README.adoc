= Site

Site is a project from https://juxt.pro[JUXT] to build a Resource Server out of
our open-source https://opencrux.com[Crux] database.

Site supports web content, and https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI]. You can use
Site as a versioned
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system[Content Management
System].

== What is Site?

CAUTION: This section describes functionality that may not yet be available.

Site is a Resource Server, built on the Crux database.

You can put things into Site with (HTTP) PUT requests. When you do this, Site
will put (the representation of) your thing (document, image, video, data…) into
the database. You can get these later with a (HTTP) GET request with the same
URI. In this way, Site behaves like a web server, with an immutable bitemporal
content store.

=== APIs

If you PUT a JSON document with a `Content-Type` of
`application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0.2`, Site will treat this as an
https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI] API definition, and serve that API for
you. This OpenAPI API definition will contain the API endpoints, and provide
schemas for the data transferred by the API. This tells the server how to
validate data coming in to the API, and how to construct data on the way out.

APIs served from Site are good web citizens. They implement HTTP method
semantics properly, with support for content negotiation, conditional requests,
range requests and authentication.

APIs are also able to benefit from Site's authorization module, Pass, providing
Policy-Based Access Control, loosely based on XACML.

== Test drive

Before you start, you'll need to have both
https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[Clojure] and
https://github.com/babashka/babashka[Babashka] installed on your system.

Clone the repo to a preferred location which we'll refer to as $SITE_HOME.

=== Start the server

Start the Site server:

----
$ $SITE_HOME/bin/site-server
----

NOTE: There is a systemd service script in `/etc/systemd`.

See link:doc[] for more documentation.

== Status

Site is very new, and is evolving. There isn't much to see yet.

Be encouraged to study the code to improve your knowledge & understanding, for
example, on how you can build a web application with Crux and spin.

[CAUTION]
--
Please be aware that many of the data structures are gradually evolving and are
therefore labelled with `alpha`, meaning you may need to make explicitly changes
to your application when upgrading to future versions of Site.

To remove the need for wholesale changes to your code when Site and some of its
supporting libraries leave alpha, it is recommended that you use namespace
aliases. For example, write `::spin/methods` instead of
`:juxt.site.alpha/methods`.

== Technical Details

Site is a RESTful web-layer over Crux. This section describes the concepts.

=== Resources

In Site, Web resources are Crux entities.

Since a resource is identified by a URI, we use its URI (or at least its path)
to identify the Crux entity too.

[source,clojure]
----
{:xt/id "https://my.site/hello"}
----

The resource's state is stored in the Crux entity's attributes, or in other Crux
entities it may reference.

[source,clojure]
----
{:xt/id "https://my.site/hello"
 :message-today "Hello World!"}
----

The resource usually has some extra special attributes, defined by our
https://github.com/juxt/spin[spin] library, which provide the resource's
configuration, such as the methods allowed on the resource.

[source,clojure]
----
{:xt/id "https://my.site/hello"
 :message-today "Hello World!"
 :juxt.spin.alpha/methods #{:get :head :options}}
----

TIP: If you want to learn more about resources, see
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-2[Section 2 of RFC 7231].

=== Representations

Representations are Clojure maps. You can either store these as Crux entities
too (for example, if the current representations are likely to change
often). But usually, you can store them with the resource's Crux entity, shown
in <<ex-hello-world>>.

[[ex-hello-world]]
.Hello World
====

This resource has just one plain-text representation. On this occasion, given
this is a static resource which remains constant, we've chosen to generate its
payload ahead-of-time.

[source,clojure]
----
(alias 'http (create-ns 'juxt.http.alpha))

{:xt/id "https://my.site/hello"
 :message-today "Hello World!"
 ::http/methods #{:get :head :options}
 ::http/representations
 [{::http/content-type "text/plain"
   ::http/content-language "en"
   ::http/content "Hello World!\r\n"
   ::http/content-length 14}]}
----
====

At this stage, don't worry that in the example, the `::http/content` value seems to
duplicate the `:message-today` value in the resource. If we want to allow the
resource's state to change, we can then generate the representation's data from
the resource's state on each web request. _The key thing to remember is that
resources and representations are separate things_.

TIP: If you want to learn more about representations, see
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3[Section 3 of RFC 7231].

== Dependencies

The web-layer is supported by some of our modern web libraries:

* https://github.com/juxt/spin[spin] -- A set of supporting functions to model
  web resources and representations as normal Clojure maps, supporting the REST
  architectural style. You can learn more by reading our
  https://www.rest.guide[guide to building RESTful Web APIs].

* https://github.com/juxt/pick[pick] -- A library to negotiate the most
  acceptable representation, if there is more than once to choose from.

* https://github.com/juxt/reap[reap] -- A low-level codec library for HTTP
  headers.

The OpenAPI features are supported by some additional libraries:

* https://github.com/juxt/jinx[jinx] -- A library for JSON Schema validation and
  coercion in Clojure and ClojureScript.
