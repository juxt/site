[NOTE]
--
In OAuth, Applications are created and authorized by an authorization
server. The actions described in this chapter could be part of another Site
instance which carries out the duties of an OAuth Authorization Server.

____
The authorization server
may be the same server as the resource serverâ€¦
____

Should we consider having a different hostname for entities managed by the
Authorization Server, e.g. `auth.site.test` ?
