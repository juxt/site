= Authentication with OpenID
:toc: left
:experimental:

Authentication is the act of establishing the identity of a person or machine.

Currently, Site does not provide its own authentication service but relies on a
third-party service known as an *OpenID Provider* that is capable of
authenticating an end-user and providing claims about them.

If Site trusts the OpenID Provider, and the OpenID Provider trusts the claims
made by the user, then Site can trust those user claims too.

== Authentication with an OpenID Provider

When communicating with an OpenID Provider, Site assumes the role of a *Relying
Party*.

When an unidentified user accesses Site, Site requests an *ID Token*, which
contains the user's claims, from the OpenID Provider. These claims are trusted
by the OpenID Provider, which signs them with a cryptographic signature that
Site can verify.

TIP: Terminology for OpenID Connect can be found at
https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Terminology

<<authentication-flow>> shows the interactions between a Alice, Site and an
OpenID Provider. Some of the details have been left out to simplify the diagram.

Understanding how the ID_TOKEN is acquired is helpful in diagnosing any
authentication issues, perhaps due to misconfiguration.

NOTE: Describe the flow in more details here.

== Requirements for authenticating with OpenID

For this flow to be possible, we need the following:

. An OpenID Provider must be selected.
. An account with the OpenID Provider must be created.
. Site needs to know about the OpenID Provider, including which endpoints to contact.
. An OAuth 2.0 Client application needs to be created with the OpenID Provider.
. Site needs to know some details about the OAuth 2.0 Client application's id and secret.
. The OAuth 2.0 Client application needs to know some details about Site, such as the callback URI.
. There needs to be at least one identity in the database that matches the ID_TOKEN.

These steps will be described in more detail in subsequent sections. But before
we get to them, we should first explain about how the identity of an end-user is
represented in Site.

////
[[identities]]
== Identities

Site stores details of the identity (or identities) of each user that might be
allowed to perform privileged actions on resources.

When an ID Token is received by Site, a matching identity must be located in the
database otherwise the end-user isn't known.

If a matching identity is found, Site will create a new `Subject` entity with a
`juxt.pass.alpha/identity` attribute referencing the `Identity` entity. This
`Subject` entity is then associated with the user's session.

An identity is a document in XTDB containing `juxt.pass.jwt/iss` and
`juxt.pass.jwt/sub` attributes which exactly match the corresponding `iss` and
`sub` properties in the ID Token. The document must also have a
`juxt.site.alpha/type` attribute with the value `"Identity"`.

These are the only constraints. The `Identity` document may have other
attributes required by the domain. For example, it may be that the `Identity`
document references a particular individual, such that an individual can have
multiple identities.

The schema chosen for the `Identity` documents is important, because it will be
coupled to the rules defined on each action.

An action's rules might use facts in the documents referenced by the Identity
document to make decisions, for example, to determine if the individual belongs
to a particular group or has been assigned a particular role.

Also, an action's rules might use facts in the `Subject` document directly, such
as the 'strength' of the login (whether the end-user used a second factor, or
whether their email address was verified).

For example, a particularly sensitive
action might require that the end-user used a second-factor when they
authenticated, or otherwise deny the action to the end-user.

TIP: Information about the 'strength' of a user's login can be encoded in the
`acr` property of an ID Token, which is copied into the `Subject` document.

<<identity-model>> shows an example relationship between a `Subject`, `Identity`
and other domain-specific documents.

.Possible relationships between documents
[[identity-model]]
====

[plantuml,identity-model,svg]
....
skinparam monochrome true
@startjson
include::identity-model.json[]
@endjson
....
====

In summary:

* a `Subject` is a document containing known facts about the end-user, including
  their identity, but also other facts about how they were authenticated.

* an `Identity` is a document that matches the `iss` and `sub` properties of a
  standard ID Token, and typically contains many more attributes (data values
  and references to other documents).

== Preparing to create identities

To allow the REPL to create the identities we require, we'll need to create an
Action to create an identity and grant permission for the REPL user to invoke
it.

This action should enforce the `juxt.site.alpha/type`, `juxt.pass.jwt/iss` and
`juxt.pass.jwt/sub` attributes that we discussed in <<identities>>. But of
course we are free to amend this action to more closely reflect our domain. For
example, we might want to ensure that it has a reference to an individual.

First we create the action:

Next, we grant the permission:

----

Finally, we create an action to get the identity.

[[selecting-openid-provider]]
== Selecting an OpenID Provider

How the OpenID Provider establishes trust in the user's claims is up to the
OpenID Provider. It's important which choose a reputable provider that you
trust.

When it comes to choosing an OpenID Provider there are many options
available. Site is compatible with any of the many OpenID Providers that
implements the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html[OpenID
Connect Discovery] protocol.

Examples include:

* https://auth0.com/[Auth0]
* https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/[AWS Cognito]
* https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/limited-login/token/[Facebook]
* https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect[Google]
* https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak]
* https://www.ory.sh/kratos[Ory Kratos]

NOTE: It's possible to register multiple OpenID Providers with Site, and there are
situations where there might be a need for more than one OAuth 2.0 Client
application to exist for a given OpenID Provider.

[[registering-the-openid-provider]]
== Registering the OpenID Provider

The examples in this section explain how to configure a particular OpenID
Provider (Auth0) but the process is similar for other providers.

Site needs to be configured which each OpenID Provider via the
`install-openid-provider!` function, as demonstrated in
<<installing-an-openid-provider>>.

Site will then download and store the OpenID Provider's configuration which will
allow it to interact with the OpenID Provider, exchange information and verify the
signatures when the OpenID Provider returns cryptographically signed data.

[[installing-an-openid-provider]]
.Adding Auth0 as an OpenID Provider
====
We first created an account with Auth0 and chose the name `juxt` in the EU
region. Auth0 created the `juxt.eu.auth0.com` domain for us, representing the
Issuer.

|===
|Issuer Identifier|+https://juxt.eu.auth0.com/+
|===

Then we registered Auth0 as an OpenID Provider in Site, with the *Issuer
Identifier* as a parameter:

[source,clojure]
----
(install-openid-provider! "https://juxt.eu.auth0.com/")
----

CAUTION: If you've decided to use Auth0 too, you'll have to decide on a tenant
name and your Issuer Identifier will be different from ours. Make sure to
remember this when following the examples in this section.

[[creating-the-client-application]]
== Creating the OAuth 2.0 Client Application

OpenID is built open OAuth 2.0, so we must create an OAuth 2.0 Client
application which can represent Site in the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

The instructions for registering an OAuth 2.0 Client application with an OpenID
Provider are usually quite similar but you should follow the instructions
provided by your chosen OpenID Provider.

To communicate with the OpenID Provider, Site must provide a number of web
resources (endpoints). Once the OAuth 2.0 Client id and secret are known, these
can be created with the `install-openid-resources!` function.

The `install-openid-resources!` function requires the following arguments:

[cols="2,8"]
|===
|name|A unique name identifying the *OpenID Provider* and application registered in Site. This is encoded into the application's URIs so it's possible to have many such combinations.
|issuer-id|The *Issuer Identifier*, this is a URL, always starting with `https://`.
|client-id|The OAuth 2.0 *Client ID*
|client-secret|The OAuth 2.0 *Client Secret*
|===

If invoked successfully, the function will return the URIs of the various Site
resources created. These can be provided as OAuth 2.0 Client settings in the
OpenID Provider, and some of these will be required.

As a complete example, <<creating-a-client-application>> explains how we created
our client application in Auth0.

.Creating the OAuth 2.0 Client application in Auth0
[[creating-a-client-application]]
====
In Auth0 we located and selected the menu:Applications[Applications] menu item.

image::Auth0-Applications-Menuitem.png[width=20%]

This brought us to a screen listing applications, and we clicked on the button
`Create Application`.

image::Auth0-Create-Application-Button.png[width=20%]

This popped up a dialog, we chose a name of `site-test` and an application type
of `Regular Web Applications`.

image::Auth0-Create-Application.png[width=75%]

After the application was created, we accessed menu:Settings[] from the application's menu bar.

image::Auth0-Application-Settings.png[]

We copied the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret`:

|===
|Client ID|d8X0TfEIcTl5oaltA4oy9ToEPdn5nFUK
|Client Secret|zb86gDUf_rEnwENYJBeih-cAzICjjPvvumThTw6qIqCVvtP83vYFtjuHni_m2ndt
|===

We returned to the REPL to install the web resources required to be provided by
the *Relying Party* (Site) by the *OpenID Provider* (Auth0), giving the
following values:

|===
|:name|auth0-site-test
|:issuer-id|+https://juxt.eu.auth0.com/+
|:client-id|d8X0TfEIcTl5oaltA4oy9ToEPdn5nFUK
|:client-secret|zb86gDUf_rEnwENYJBeih-cAzICjjPvvumThTw6qIqCVvtP83vYFtjuHni_m2ndt
|===

We created the required web resources for the application by invoking the
`install-openid-resources!` function.

[source,clojure]
----
(install-openid-resources!
:name "auth0-site-test"
:issuer-id "https://juxt.eu.auth0.com/"
:client-id "d8X0TfEIcTl5oaltA4oy9ToEPdn5nFUK"
:client-secret "zb86gDUf_rEnwENYJBeih-cAzICjjPvvumThTw6qIqCVvtP83vYFtjuHni_m2ndt")
----

Calling the `install-openid-resources!` function returned a map:

[source,clojure]
----
{:login-uri "https://site.test/_site/openid/auth0-site-test/login",
 :callback-uri "https://site.test/_site/openid/auth0-site-test/callback"}
----

This map contained the application's URIs, which we made a note of.

|===
|Application Login URI|+https://site.test/_site/openid/auth0-site-test/login+
|Allowed Callback URLs|+https://site.test/_site/openid/auth0-site-test/callback+
|===

Then we returned to the Auth0 settings and scrolled down to the `Application URIs` section.

We entered in the application URIs as shown below:

== Creating a login page

<<create-login-page>> shows how we can create a simple login page to link to our
`Application Login URI`.

[[creating-identities]]
== Creating identities

====
Now we can create an identity:

[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/demo.clj[tag=create-identity!,indent=0]
----

We shall also grant this identity the permission to read itself.

[source,clojure]
----
include::../../test/juxt/demo.clj[tag=grant-permission-for-alice-to-get-alice!,indent=0]
----

We can now test this in a browser. Navigate to https://site.test/~alice
====
////

== Authenticating an end-user

We're now ready to test our authentication.

====
Navigate to https://site.test/_site/openid/auth0-site-test/login
====

Authentication is achieved by acquiring an ID_TOKEN from the OpenID
Provider. The ID_TOKEN is like a contact card for the user, and contains
personal information we can consider when deciding whether to authorize an
end-user's access to a resource.

If the end-user is using a browser, we can ask them to navigate to the
`Application Login URI` that we have installed.

Site must acquire an ID_TOKEN in order to identify a
subject. <<authentication-flow>> discusses the steps involved.

The handler at the `Application Login URI` creates a session with some initial
state before redirecting us over to the `OpenID Provider` to authenticate us.

Once authenticated, the `OpenID Provider` redirects us back to the `Callback
URI` with a code. The handler at this URI uses this code to acquire the ID_TOKEN
from the OpenID Provider, adding this to the session before redirecting us back
to our original resource.

The session now contains the information contained in the ID_TOKEN, and we can
move on to <<authorization>>.
